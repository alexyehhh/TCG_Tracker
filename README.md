# TCG_Tracker

- Our TCG Tracker will allow users to determine whether a card is worth getting graded based on:
  - cost
  - grading cost
  - price of a graded card
- Features we want to implement
  - A user can either look up the card by its name or scan it with our app
  - Users will also be able to add their trading cards to their own personalized database which keeps track of its cost and value.
